Orbital Sync synchronizes multiple Pi-hole instances for high availability (HA) using the built-in "teleporter". In
other words, it performs a "backup" in the Pi-hole admin interface of your primary Pi-hole instance, and then "restores"
that backup to any number of "secondary" Pi-holes also via their admin interface. As a result, it supports the
synchronization of anything currently supported by Pi-hole's "teleporter". See
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for the defaults.

I love [gravity-sync](https://github.com/vmstan/gravity-sync), but I personally found it to be difficult to set up in
some contexts. Gravity Sync's approach is much more efficient, because it checks if there are any changes on the
primary before importing them on the secondary and restarting any services. I'm under the impression that this project,
however, will restart your secondary Pi-hole's DNS server any time a sync is performed because it is "restoring" a
backup.

## Getting Started

### Docker

The following is an example Docker Compose file for running this project. See the
[environment variables](#environment-variables) section for more configuration options.

```yaml
version: 3
services:
  orbital-sync:
    image: mattwebbio/orbital-sync
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      PRIMARY_HOST_BASE_URL: 'https://pihole1.example.com'
      PRIMARY_HOST_PASSWORD: 'your_password1'
      SECONDARY_HOST_1_BASE_URL: 'https://pihole2.example.com'
      SECONDARY_HOST_1_PASSWORD: 'your_password2'
      SECONDARY_HOST_2_BASE_URL: 'http://192.168.1.3'
      SECONDARY_HOST_2_PASSWORD: 'your_password3'
      INTERVAL_MINUTES: 30
```

### Node

```shell
npm install -g orbital-sync
orbital-sync
```

## Requirements

The admin web interfaces of all Pi-holes must be accessible by the container/server running this service. In other words,
they have to be on the same network.

It is recommended you run this service with Docker.

Secondary hosts must be sequential (`SECONDARY_HOST_1_BASE_URL`, `SECONDARY_HOST_2_BASE_URL`,
`SECONDARY_HOST_3_BASE_URL`, and so on) and start at number `1`. Any gaps (for example, `3` to `5` skipping `4`) will
result in hosts after the gap being skipped in the sync process.
